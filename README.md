# BIZZ-HEYATHI-PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGE
A Programming language based on Python using SLY Library

What is SLY ?
--SLY is library for writing parsers and compilers.
There are two classes in SLY :
(i)  lexer :
 The Lexer class is used to break input text into a collection of tokens specified by a collection of regular expression rules.
(ii) parser :
 The Parser class is used to recognize language syntax that has been specified in the form of a context free grammar. 
                                                             
How to use Sly ?

--Install 'sly' in your Computer by following command : pip install sly 
--Once the Library is Installed , sly is ready to use to create your own programming language 
--Now in order to use any Library in Python we use 'import' keyword ..Similarly, we write 'import sly' at the beginning of 
  the program 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Program a lexer for a programming language .
(Lexer is the process of converting a sequence of Caracter into sequence of Tokens)

2)Programming a parser .
(A parser is a compiler or interpreter component that breaks data into smaller elements for easy translation into another language)
